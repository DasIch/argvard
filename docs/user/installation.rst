Installation
============

In order to get started you need Python 2.7, Python 3.3 or a higher Python 3
version. Argvard is tested on CPython and PyPy but using other interpreters
should work just as well.

It is recommended that you install Argvard -- or any other Python library --
inside a virtual environment, created with virtualenv_. This allows you to
isolate the projects you are working on from each other and the system.

Within a virtual environment you can install Argvard using pip_::

    $ pip install argvard

This should take just a moment and then you are good to go.
